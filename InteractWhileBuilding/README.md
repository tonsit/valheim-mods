# InteractWhileBuilding for Valheim

Allows you to interact with objects in the world while in build mode.

Enables the Use interactions (Default is 'E' on keyboard) for objects like doors, fireplaces, and containers while holding items like the hammer and hoe.

Adjusts the position of the WearNTear GUI element up slightly so that it doesn't overlap with the action text.
