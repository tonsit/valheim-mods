# SafetyNet Plugin for Valheim

Have you ever jumped while running down a hill and fallen to your death?

Have you ever ran out of stamina right before you jump into the water and die before you make it back to shore?

This mod is for you!

SafetyNet prevents damage from common environmental effects.
Default configuration is set to prevent both fall and swim damage.

Configuration allows for additional prevention of fire (burning), smoked and freezing damage.

*Disclaimer: I take no responsibility for sudden deaths that may occur during the use of this plugin.*
